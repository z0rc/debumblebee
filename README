DESCRIPTION

This is a fork/major rewrite of original bumblebee project. I've made this fork
because I was very unsatisfied with current bumblebee installation script which
was a real mess. The main point of this project is to create polished and
modular version of bumblebee.

This project allows you to utilize nVidia graphics card with proprietary driver
while running main desktop on Intel card. This service is only for Intel/nVidia
combination, it won't work with Intel/ATI or any other combination.

Also it provides experimental support of nouveau module, but main goal is still
support of proprietary driver.

debumblebee is combination of additional X server for nVidia graphics card and
VirtualGL package which allows to access nVidia X server screen from Intel X
server screen with full OpenGL support.

Right now this script supports only Debian and LinuxMint based on Debian. Feel
free to add support of any other distro. I'll gladly accept your changes. If you
have any questions about adding support please check INSTALL file for detailed
instructions of what should be done by installation script.


USAGE

Check INSTALL file for details. After installation your desktop and all
applications will be running on Intel card. To run application with nVidia card
you need to start it with optirun, for example: "optirun glxgears".


LIMITATIONS

Right now VDPAU video playback isn't supported.


TROUBLESHOOTING

"[VGL] ERROR: Could not open display :8"
This means that nVidia X server wasn't able to start with current configuration.
First you need to check /var/log/Xorg.8.log for "(EE)" strings. Usually this
provides enough information for troubleshooting.

The most common issue at this situation is that nVidia module fails to
autodetect name of connected monitor (DFP-0 or CRT-0). You may report this bug,
but you need to attach /var/log/Xorg.8.log, /etc/X11/xorg.conf.nvidia with
outputs of "nvidia-xconfig --query-gpu-info" and
"dmidecode --string system-product-name". DO NOT provide this directly in your
ticket, USE pastebin. Manually this issue can be fixed by adding the following
string into Device section in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.nvidia:
Option "ConnectedMonitor" "DFP-0"
If it isn't helping, then try to change "DFP-0" to "CRT-0".

If you have other issues about GL errors, then it's recommended to check for
notices about libglx.so and GLX in Xorg log.

I saw many reports about wine crashing when lauched through optirun. This is
problem of wine package, not debumblebee. First, it's VERY outdated. You may
pull wine-unstable packages from sid or even better use fresh packages from
http://dev.carbon-project.org/debian/wine-unstable/

Anyway, if you have any issues please create ticket at
https://github.com/z0rc/debumblebee


TODO

* Rewrite optirun with perl, so it can use SGID bit which allows to apply more
  strict security permissions and get rid of sudoers file.
